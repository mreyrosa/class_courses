  <p> Most of the challenges and troubles that I had with this assignment were related to how rusty I was with HTML. Just getting used to using tags
  after using other languages such as C++ and C took awhile for me. Something that also took me awhile to realize was that I needed to set permissions
  on the files so that I could view them on a browser. </p>

  <p> Although I didn't really learn anything new from this assignment, I found that this assignment was a really good refresher about HTML.</p>

  <p> The most useful resource that I used for this assignment was the HTML tutorials at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools.com.</a>
  Because I used this website to help learn HTML when I was first introduced to it, I was able to use the website to quickly familiarize
  myself with HTML again.</p>
