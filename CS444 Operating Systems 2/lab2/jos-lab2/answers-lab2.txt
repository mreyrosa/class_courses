2.  0xf0000000  |   KERNBASE, Page table for 4MB of memory
    0xefc00000  |   MMIOLIM, Memory mapped I/O (KSTACKTOP - PTSIZE)
    0xef800000  |   MMIOBASE, Memory mapped I/O (MMIOLIM - PTSIZE)
    0xef400000  |   UVPT, User read-only virtual page table
    0xef000000  |   UPAGES, Read-only copies of the Page structures
    0x00800000  |   UTEXT, Where user programs generally begin
    0x00400000  |   UTEMP, Used for temporary page mappings

3. User programs won't be able to read or write the kernel's memory due to
privilege levels. Kernel programs operate in ring 0, whereas user programs
operate in ring 3. Programs can't access things in a ring level lower than they
are, (i.e. ring 3 programs (user programs) can't access ring 0 stuff (kernel
memory).

4.The maximum amount of physical memory that JOS can support is 256 MB. Because
KERNBASE starts at f0000000, there are 8 values that can change, 2^8 = 256,
hence the 256 MB

5. Managing memory required sizeof(PageInfo * npages) = 256 KB,  4 KB for page
directory, PGSIZE is 4096, so 4096 + 256 + 4 = 4356 KB.

6. We transition to running at an EIP above KERNBASE when we use the instruction
    jmp *%eax
It is possible fo us to continue executing at a low EIP because we map virtual
addresses to physical addresses. The transition is necessary because C code
expects a high address.
