1. The purpose of having an individual handler funciton is so that the system can distinguish between the different interrupts.

2. I didn't have to do anything in particular to make the softint program behave correctly. If the program triggers interrupt 14 instead of 13, then it could mess with virtual memory.

3. There's a DPL field in the SETGATE call that needs to be set to 3 for BRKPT otherwise it operates at the wrong privilege level.

4. The point of these mechanisms is to prevent user programs from accessing stuff that they're not supposed to.
